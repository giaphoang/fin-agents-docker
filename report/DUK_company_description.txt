Business Segments 

Duke Energy's segment structure includes two reportable business segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&#38;I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&#38;I). The remainder of Duke Energy&#8217;s operations is presented as Other. Commercial Renewables is reported as discontinued operations and is no longer a reportable segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Dispositions," for further details. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Business Segments.&#8221; The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy&#8217;s business segments, as well as Other. 

ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

EU&#38;I conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. EU&#38;I provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 8.4 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately 90,000 square miles across six states with a total estimated population of 27 million. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. 

During 2021, Duke Energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a 19.9% minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction was completed following two closings. Additionally, in November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay, which was moved to EU&#38;I. Duke Energy entered into purchase and sale agreements with affiliates of Brookfield for the sale of the utility-scale solar and wind group in June 2023 and with affiliates of ArcLight for the distributed generation group in July 2023. Both transactions closed in October 2023. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Dispositions," for additional information. 

EU&#38;I is also a joint owner in certain electric transmission projects. EU&#38;I has a 50% ownership interest in DATC, a partnership with American Transmission Company, formed to design, build and operate transmission infrastructure. DATC owns 72% of the transmission service rights to Path 15, an 84-mile transmission line in central California. EU&#38;I also has a 50% ownership interest in Pioneer, which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. The following map shows the service territory for EU&#38;I as of December 31, 2023. 

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

The electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the NRC, the NCUC, the PSCSC, the FPSC, the IURC, the PUCO and the KPSC. 

The following table represents the distribution of GWh billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The number of residential and general service customers within the EU&#38;I service territory is expected to increase over time. Growth in weather-normal sales volumes, however, was lower in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to the continuation of energy efficiency adoption, rooftop solar and broad weakness across industrial sectors. While migration to EU&#38;I's service territory remained strong, residential sales decreased due primarily to the return to more normal post-pandemic activities and economic conditions throughout the year. Lower industrial sales continued due to overall industrial weakness, including some manufacturing plant closings across certain jurisdictions, continuation of supply chain constraints and higher inventory levels, as well as higher interest rates. This was partially offset by higher data center usage, which contributed to growth in commercial sales volumes. The impact on customer's usage from these factors and other potential economic dynamics continues to be monitored. Over the longer time frame, it is still expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time. 

Seasonality and the Impact of Weather 

Revenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Although decoupling mechanisms may mitigate some weather impacts, residential and general service customers are typically more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. 

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers&#8217; historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. Estimates of weather impacts may be more difficult to determine during periods of extreme or more volatile weather. 

Heating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day. 

Competition 

Retail 

EU&#38;I&#8217;s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. EU&#38;I owns and operates facilities necessary to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electricity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. 

In Ohio, EU&#38;I conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. EU&#38;I earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity, but not on the cost of the underlying energy. 

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites. 

Wholesale 

Duke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power, reliability of service and price. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs. 

Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect EU&#38;I&#8217;s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of EU&#38;I to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. 

Energy Capacity and Resources 

EU&#38;I owns approximately 54,772 MW of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2, &#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause EU&#38;I to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. EU&#38;I has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply. 

EU&#38;I&#8217;s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. 

Sources of Electricity 

EU&#38;I relies principally on natural gas, nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2023. 

##TABLE_START Cost of Delivered Fuel per Net Generation by Source Kilowatt-hour Generated (Cents) 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

Natural Gas and Fuel Oil 

Natural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for EU&#38;I&#8217;s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. EU&#38;I believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future. 

EU&#38;I has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of EU&#38;I&#8217;s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Duke Energy Florida has temporarily agreed to not hedge natural gas prices, but retains an ability to propose hedging again in annual fuel docket filings. 

EU&#38;I has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. EU&#38;I may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The EU&#38;I natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines. 

Nuclear 

The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies. 

EU&#38;I has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. EU&#38;I staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, EU&#38;I generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts. 

EU&#38;I has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100% of its uranium concentrates through at least 2027, 100% of its conversion services through at least 2029, 100% of its enrichment services through at least 2027, and 100% of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, EU&#38;I believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services. 

Coal 

EU&#38;I meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. EU&#38;I uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners, range from 2024 to 2027 for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Indiana, 2024 to 2026 for Duke Energy Florida and 2024 to 2025 for Duke Energy Ohio. EU&#38;I expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. EU&#38;I has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption. Coal inventory levels may fluctuate as a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet. EU&#38;I continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts. 

Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is primarily produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. There are adequate domestic coal reserves to serve EU&#38;I's coal generation needs through end of life. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by EU&#38;I is between 0.5% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, between 1% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Florida, and between 0.5% and 4.0% for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. EU&#38;I's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances, enable EU&#38;I to satisfy current SO 2 emission limitations for its existing facilities. 

Purchased Power 

EU&#38;I purchases a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. EU&#38;I believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected. 

The following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years:

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

Inventory 

EU&#38;I must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2023, the inventory balance for EU&#38;I was approximately $4.1 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; 

Ash Basin Management 

The EPA has issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants including the CCR Rule. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act). 

EU&#38;I has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. Closure activities have begun in all of Duke Energy's jurisdictions. Excavation began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or for reuse in an approved beneficial application. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. 

The EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress&#8217; wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, "Other Matters" and Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Commitments and Contingencies" and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively. 

Nuclear Matters 

Duke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $16.2 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies.&#8221; 

Duke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC and the PSCSC require Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress update cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. The nuclear decommissioning liabilities are assessed and updated based on changes in cash flows provided in new studies as well as annual assessments to evaluate whether any indicators suggest a change in the estimate of the ARO is necessary. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2023 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.

(c) Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2023 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2024. A funding study was last completed and filed in 2019. An updated funding study will be completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2024. 

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

(d) Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2019 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in March 2020. Duke Energy Progress also completed a funding study, which was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in July 2020. In October 2021, Duke Energy Progress filed the 2019 nuclear decommissioning cost study with the FERC, as well as a revised date schedule for decommissioning expense to be collected from wholesale customers. The FERC accepted the filing, as filed on December 9, 2021. 

(e) During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. Duke Energy Florida provides the FPSC periodic reports on the status and progress of decommissioning activities. 

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed EU&#38;I to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. EU&#38;I believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations.&#8221; 

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so EU&#38;I will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites. 

Under federal law, the DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel. 

Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. With certain modifications and approvals by the NRC to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee and Robinson. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation. 

The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction. 

EU&#38;I is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. In June 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal application for Oconee with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew Oconee's operating license for an additional 20 years. Duke Energy has announced its intention to seek 20-year operating license renewals for each of the reactors it operates in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters,&#8221; for additional information. 

##TABLE_START Unit Year of Expiration Duke Energy Carolinas Catawba Units 1 and 2 2043 McGuire Unit 1 2041 McGuire Unit 2 2043 Oconee Units 1 and 2 2033 Oconee Unit 3 2034 Duke Energy Progress Brunswick Unit 1 2036 Brunswick Unit 2 2034 Harris 2046 Robinson 2030 ##TABLE_END

The NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on nuclear decommissioning activity, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations." 

Regulation 

State 

The state electric utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state electric utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of EU&#38;I&#8217;s generating facilities. CPCNs issued by the state electric utility commissions, as applicable, authorize EU&#38;I to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state electric utility commission is required for the entities within EU&#38;I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

In addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state electric utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. 

Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by EU&#38;I. EU&#38;I uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of EU&#38;I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of EU&#38;I. 

The table below reflects significant electric rate case applications approved and effective in the past three years and applications currently pending approval.

Federal 

The FERC approves EU&#38;I&#8217;s cost-based rates for electric sales to certain power and transmission wholesale customers. Regulations of FERC and the state electric utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with EU&#38;I. 

RTOs 

PJM and MISO are the ISOs and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch. 

Duke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.

GAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

GU&#38;I conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, TPUC, PHMSA and the FERC. GU&#38;I serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers, including customers served by municipalities who are wholesale customers. GU&#38;I has over 1.7 million total customers, including approximately 1.2 million customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 560,000 customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville. The following map shows the service territory and investments in operating pipelines for GU&#38;I as of December 31, 2023. 

The number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the GU&#38;I service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. 

GU&#38;I also has investments in various pipeline transmission projects, renewable natural gas projects and natural gas storage facilities. 

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

Natural Gas for Retail Distribution 

GU&#38;I is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. GU&#38;I&#8217;s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows GU&#38;I to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, GU&#38;I may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions and/or make wholesale secondary market sales. In 2023, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided for approximately 96% of the natural gas supply for both Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio during the winter months and 100% of forecasted demand was under contract prior to the winter heating season. 

Impact of Weather 

GU&#38;I revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium general service customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation. 

Competition 

GU&#38;I&#8217;s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. GU&#38;I owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. GU&#38;I earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices. 

In residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. GU&#38;I's primary product competition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs. 

Higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings. 

Natural Gas Investments 

Duke Energy, through its GU&#38;I segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail Phase I mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The remaining lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC was placed into service in March 2018. Phase II of Sabal Trail went into service in May 2020, adding approximately 200,000 Dth of capacity to the Sabal Trail pipeline. 

Duke Energy, through its GU&#38;I segment, has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP, which planned to build the ACP pipeline, an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP pipeline was intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets and would be regulated by FERC. Dominion Energy owns 53% of ACP and was contracted to construct and operate the ACP pipeline upon completion. On July 5, 2020, Dominion announced a sale of substantially all of its natural gas transmission and storage segment assets, which were critical to the ACP pipeline. Further, permitting delays and legal challenges had materially affected the timing and cost of the pipeline. As a result, Duke Energy determined that they would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline. 

Duke Energy, also through its GU&#38;I segment, has investments in various renewable natural gas joint ventures. 

GU&#38;I has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC. 

KO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities was co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC. KO Transmission sold all of its pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC on February 1, 2023, for approximately book value. 

See Notes 4, 13 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates" and "Variable Interest Entities," respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's and GU&#38;I's natural gas investments. 

##TABLE_START BUSINESS ##TABLE_END

Inventory 

GU&#38;I must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2023, the inventory balance for GU&#38;I was $129 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 

Regulation 

State 

The state gas utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state gas utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of GU&#38;I&#8217;s natural gas distribution facilities. CPCNs issued by the state gas utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&#38;I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state gas utility commission is required for GU&#38;I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 

In addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent. 

Natural gas costs are eligible for recovery by GU&#38;I. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of GU&#38;I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of GU&#38;I.

Financial Results 

(a) See Results of Operations below for Duke Energy&#8217;s definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per basic share. 

Duke Energy's 2023 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) was impacted by higher regulatory charges in the prior year. Additional drivers primarily include growth from riders and other retail margin, favorable rate case impacts, lower operations and maintenance expense and lower tax expense. These items were partially offset by higher interest and depreciation expense, unfavorable weather and lower volumes. See &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy&#8217;s reportable business segments, as well as Other. 

2023 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments 

Clean Energy Transition . Our industry continues to experience an unprecedented level of change and 2023 was a dynamic year for our company as we navigated ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and continued to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver on our vision. 

Generating Cleaner Energy 

We are targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and a full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals, as part of the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. We have made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation (a 48% reduction from 2005) and h ave established goals to do more (at least 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040, and net zero by 2050). We are also working to reduce Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, by 50% by 2035, on the way to net zero by 2050. 

Duke Energy was one of the first utilities to address the totality of its impact &#8211; approximately 95% of the Company's greenhouse gas emissions are tied to a measurable net zero goal. Over the next decade, we expect to deploy between approximately $170 and $180 billion of capital into our regulated businesses, driven by clean energy transition investments. These investments will drive substantial economic benefits for the communities we serve and reduce our customers' exposure to fuel volatility. We have filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions, allowing us to make needed investments to increase grid resiliency and enable coal plant retirements, renewables and energy storage. 

As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will actively work to advocate for research and development and deployment of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. This includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels. 

Sale of Commercial Renewables 

In November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay. As we look forward to the remainder of this decade and beyond, we have line of sight to significant renewable, grid and other investment opportunities within our faster-growing regulated operations. We closed on the sales of the commercial utility-scale solar and wind group and the distributed generation group in October 2023, facilitating our transition to a fully regulated utility. 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A DUKE ENERGY ##TABLE_END

Carolinas Integrated Resource Plan 

HB 951 was passed in 2021 reflecting North Carolina policy accelerating a clean energy transition for generation while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for our customers. The legislation established a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO 2 emission reductions in North Carolina through the use of least cost planning, including stakeholder involvement, and also introduced modernized recovery mechanisms under PBR, which consists of MYRP, PIMS, and residential decoupling, and promotes more efficient recovery of investments and aligns incentives between the Company and the state&#8217;s energy policy objectives. 

In May 2022, we filed a proposed Carbon Plan with the NCUC that outlined potential pathways toward achieving the HB 951 carbon reduction targets while balancing affordability and reliability for our customers and in December 2022, the NCUC issued an order adopting its initial Carbon Plan, which included a set of near-term actions to support meeting the state's carbon reduction goals. In August 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed an updated combined systemwide Carolinas IRP with the NCUC and the PSCSC, setting the course for the next 15 years of our clean energy transition. The plan outlined the diverse resources required to serve customers reliably and to achieve our clean energy transition in both states. In January 2024, we filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC due to substantially increased load forecasts resulting from continued economic development successes in the Carolinas occurring since the system-wide plan was prepared. 

Modernizing the Power Grid and Natural Gas Infrastructure 

We are leveraging new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape and our grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for our customers. We continue to enhance our customers' experience with the Self-Optimizing Grid (SOG), our flagship grid improvement program spanning all of Duke Energy&#8217;s regulated utilities. In 2023, our SOG investments helped to avoid approximately 330,000 customer interruptions across our six-state electric service area, preventing customers from having more than 1.4 million hours of lost outage time during major events. 

Investments in integrity management of our natural gas infrastructure continue to be of importance to ensure reliable, safe, and increasingly clean delivery of natural gas to our customers. Recognizing the importance of natural gas, we continue to work toward a net-zero methane emission goal by 2030 related to our natural gas distribution business. In our LDC business, we remain focused on reducing methane emissions, leveraging our partnerships, emissions platform, sensors and other technologies to find and fix leaks in near real time. We also use cross compression to avoid releasing natural gas into the atmosphere during certain operational activities. 

In October, we announced plans to build and operate our first system capable of producing, storing and combusting 100% green hydrogen. The one-of-its-kind, end-to-end system will use solar energy at Duke Energy Florida's 74.5-MW DeBary solar plant to produce green hydrogen for an upgraded on-site CT designed to operate on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen or up to 100% hydrogen. We anticipate the system will be installed and fully functioning in 2024, providing access to on-demand, dispatchable, increasingly clean energy for our Duke Energy Florida customers. 

Response to Macroeconomic Headwinds . While 2023 presented unique macroeconomic challenges, Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of executing on our business plans while driving efficiencies and productivity in the business. Despite rising interest rates and near-record mild weather across all of our service territories, we achieved financial results within our adjusted EPS guidance and continued our cost-management journey with a focus on driving productivity, increasing flexibility and prioritizing spend based on risk and strategic value to our customers and investors. We executed on our Workload Reduction Initiative launched in late 2022 while building on our culture of continuous improvement to continue to identify ways to reduce operating costs. We remain focused on organization simplification, automation, reducing service levels provided to internal customers as appropriate, outsourcing, and continued operational excellence. 

Volatile commodity prices led to rapid fuel cost increases in 2022, impacting the price of electricity in all of our jurisdictions. We actively worked to manage and maintain prices at lower levels than they otherwise would have been in light of increased commodity prices, working with our regulators to extend recovery periods in certain jurisdictions in a way that was manageable for our customers. In 2023, we made substantial progress, recovering $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs this year. With these actions, lower fuel prices, and increased stability in these markets during 2023, we anticipate to be in line with our historical average balance of deferred fuel costs by the end of 2024. 

While inflation has moderated to a degree, we continue to successfully navigate supply chain challenges including longer lead times and shortages of solar panels and other equipment. We execute longer supply agreements and proactively secure equipment in advance of hurricane season. Our procurement teams continue to execute on action plans to enhance planning, augment supply, amend operations and leverage our scale to continue to mitigate these risks to the extent possible. 

Recent macroeconomic headwinds aside, the level of economic development success and growth experienced in our service territories is significantly above what we have experienced over the last two decades. In 2023, Site Selection magazine recognized Duke Energy as a &#8220;Top Utility in Economic Development," recognizing our critical role and successful efforts working with our state partners to win 67 projects this year alone, representing approximately $22 billion in new capital investment and 15,000 new jobs within our service territories. These projects include transformational electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities as well as data centers. Supporting the increasing generation load demands expected from projects like these in the coming years is an immense opportunity for our Company and the communities we proudly serve. 

Constructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes . One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs across all of our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. Grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth and we have a MYRP in Florida through 2024. 

In North Carolina, as highlighted above, HB 951 authorizes the use of modernized regulatory constructs under the direction of the NCUC. In October 2022, Duke Energy Progress filed its first North Carolina rate case utilizing PBR and reached partial settlements on key matters in April and May 2023. In August 2023, the NCUC issued a constructive order approving these partial settlements and Duke Energy Progress' PBR Application with certain modifications, marking the first implementation of an MYRP under the performance-based regulations authorized by HB 951. Duke Energy Progress implemented revised Year 1 rates on October 1, 2023. In January 2023, we also filed a Duke Energy Carolinas rate case in North Carolina, which incorporated elements of PBR. In August 2023, we reached partial settlements on key matters with the Public Staff and received a constructive order from the NCUC in December 2023, with new rates effective January 2024. After more than a decade of work, these rate cases mark a significant milestone in securing regulatory approval of modern ratemaking structures in North Carolina. 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A DUKE ENERGY ##TABLE_END

In addition to the Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas rate cases in North Carolina, we continued to move a variety of other regulatory initiatives forward during 2023. In February 2023, the PSCSC approved a constructive comprehensive settlement with all parties in the Duke Energy Progress South Carolina rate case and we implemented new customer rates effective April 1, 2023. In the Midwest, we received a constructive order on our Duke Energy Kentucky electric rate case in October 2023. As it relates to our natural gas businesses, in Duke Energy Ohio, we filed a stipulation on key matters in our base rate case with all parties except the OCC in April 2023. We received an order approving the stipulation in November 2023. In September 2023, the TPUC approved a settlement related to our Annual Review Mechanism in Tennessee, with adjusted rates effective October 1, 2023. Overall, this was a very active year as it relates to regulatory filings, which reflects the important investments and ongoing clean energy transition across all our service territories. 

In 2022, storm securitization legislation was passed in South Carolina, providing the opportunity to securitize deferred storm costs and lower the bill impacts for our customers. In 2023, w e made progress on our South Carolina storm securitization filings. The PSCSC approved a comprehensive settlement in September 2023 and issued its financing order in October 2023. Also in South Carolina, we filed a Duke Energy Carolinas rate case with the PSCSC in January 2024. 

W e also continued to evaluate the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to have significant benefits to customers and lower the cost of the clean energy transition. In 2023, we worked to advocate successfully for the best interests of our customers, communities, and Company in important areas, including the preservation and application of nuclear PTCs in the regulated utility business model. 

Customer Satisfaction . Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are most important to the customer experience. While customer satisfaction across our industry continues to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment and the impacts of inflationary pressures including higher fuel prices on customer bills, our work continues to be recognized by our customers, with strong customer satisfaction scores in our jurisdictions including Piedmont, which was ranked number one in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for residential natural gas service in the south for the second year in a row. 

Operational Excellence, Safety and Reliability . The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities continues to be foundational to serving our customers, our financial results, and our credibility with stakeholders. Late 2022 presented unique challenges to the grid in our service territories, including attacks on two substations in Moore County, North Carolina, and extreme winter weather that forced us to take unprecedented measures to ensure the integrity of our systems in North Carolina. 

Following the Moore County Substation attack, we reassessed the criticality of every substation, evaluated new security tools and technology, and conducted benchmarking with peer utilities. We created a plan to enhance physical security and resiliency at sites that are critical to the Bulk Electric System and those with the greatest impact to customers. We will work to implement these enhancements across all jurisdictions, representing an investment of approximately $500 million over the next three years. In North Carolina, recovery has been approved through the MYRP. Cost recovery requests in South Carolina, Florida and the Midwest are expected to be included in future rate cases. 

In December 2022, high winds and extreme cold from Winter Storm Elliott, customer demand that was higher than forecasted, and the inability to import additional power from out of state, resulted in the need to temporarily interrupt service to about 500,000 customers to maintain overall grid reliability and prevent further potential disruptions in the Carolinas. In 2023, we established the Bulk Electric System Oversight Board to provide executive oversight of programs and policies designed to ensure energy adequacy for our customers. We practiced our forecasting, grid assessment, oversight, and governance processes throughout the summer, as hot weather challenged operations from time to time. We will continue to work to ensure that our grid and fleet can withstand the stress of extreme weather on our system, evaluate lessons learned and enhance our strategy and communications to effectively serve our customers now and in the future. 

Despite these recent challenges, our regulated generation fleet and nuclear sites had strong performance throughout the year and our electric distribution system performed well. The safety of our workforce is a core value and we remain an industry leader in personal safety. In 2023, we achieved one of the best safety records in our company&#8217;s history with our TICR significantly above target. For the eighth consecutive year, we ranked first among North American combined gas and electric companies in Edison Electric Institute&#8217;s (EEI) annual safety survey, and our gas operations organization finished in the top 10% for the third year in a row, according to the American Gas Association. And, for the first time since our merger with Progress Energy in 2012, we finished the year with less than 100 Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incidents. In addition, we continued our strong environmental performance, with no reportable environmental events. 

Our workforce and our contract partners worked hard to prepare for this year&#8217;s storm season, through drills, material planning, call center readiness, contingency planning, and customer communications. This summer, we experienced extreme weather across our regions, including a July 4 series of major storms in the Midwest, numerous storms in July and August in the Carolinas, and Hurricane Idalia in August, impacting Florida and the east coast of the Carolinas. We safely restored power to 95% of affected customers within 48 hours. Our preparation and robust communications to our customers and communities enhanced our reputation and built stakeholder loyalty and support. 

Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2023 storm response efforts while making ongoing investments to enhance the reliability and physical security of the grid, mitigate ongoing macroeconomic challenges, and navigate supply chain constraints, is a testament to our team&#8217;s extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Duke Energy has received 20 Emergency Response Awards since EEI began recognizing storm response in 1998 (including 11 for assisting other utilities). 

Duke Energy Objectives &#8211; 2024 and Beyond 

At Duke Energy, our business strategy centers on delivering reliable, affordable and cleaner energy to our customers and communities, safely transforming and readying our system by investing in innovative technologies, modernizing our gas and electric infrastructure and expanding and integrating efficiency and demand management programs. As we transition our business to cleaner sources of energy, we are focused on delivering sustainable value for our customers and shareholders by leveraging business transformation to exceed customer expectations, optimizing investments to drive attractive shareholder returns, and by providing new product offerings and solutions that deliver growth and customer value. To achieve these major milestones, we are shaping the landscape by partnering with stakeholders, championing public policy that advances innovation, and advancing regulatory models that support carbon and methane emission reductions.

Matters Impacting Future Results 

The matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments. 

Regulatory Matters 

Coal Ash Costs 

Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have approximately $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, in regulatory assets related to coal ash retirement obligations as of December 31, 2023. Future spending, including amounts recorded for depreciation and liability accretion, is expected to continue to be deferred and recovered in future rate cases or rider fil ings. The majority of spend is primarily expected to occur over the next 10 years. 

Duke Energy Indiana has interprete d the CCR Rule to identif y the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and established methods of compliance. Interpretation of the requirements of the CCR Rule is subject to further legal challenges and regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR Rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal a sh. Duke Energy Indiana has approximately $408 million in regulatory assets related to coal ash asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2023. See &#8220;Other Matters&#8221; and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" for more information. 

Fuel Cost Recovery 

As a result of rapidly rising commodity costs during 2022, including natural gas, fuel and purchased power prices in excess of amounts included in fuel-related revenues led to an increase in the undercollection of fuel costs from customers in jurisdictions including Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. These amounts were deferred in regulatory assets and impacted the cash flows of the registrants, including increased borrowings to temporarily finance related expenditures until recovery. Natural gas costs stabilized in 2023 and the Duke Energy Registrants are making progress collecting deferred fuel balances. Regulatory filings have been made and approved for re covery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs. Across all jurisdictions, Duke Energy recovered $1.5 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2023, and expects deferred fuel cost balances to be back in line with historical norms by the end of 2024. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" for more information. 

Commercial Renewables 

In November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups. The Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups were classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Duke Energy entered into purchase and sale agreements with affiliates of Brookfield in June 2023 for the sale of the utility-scale solar and wind group and with affiliates of ArcLight in July 2023 for the distributed generation group. Both transactions closed in October 2023 and proceeds from the sales were used for debt avoidance. Duke Energy expects to complete the disposition of the remaining assets in the first half of 2024. For more information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Dispositions." 

In February 2021, a severe winter storm impacted certain Commercial Renewables assets in Texas. Extreme weather conditions limited the ability for these solar and wind facilities to generate and sell electricity into the market. Originally, Duke Energy (Parent) was named in multiple lawsuits arising out of this winter storm, but the plaintiffs have dismissed Duke Energy (parent) from these lawsuits. The legal actions related to all but one of the project companies in this matter transferred to affiliates of Brookfield in conjunction with the transaction closing in October 2023. For more information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies." 

Supply Chain 

In 2023, Duke Energy has experienced modest improvement in the stability of the markets for key materials purchased and used by the Company. The Company continues to monitor developments, including proposed federal regulations, that could disrupt or impact the Company's supply chain and, as a result, may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results, or the achievement of its clean energy goals. 

Goodwill 

The Duke Energy Registrants performed their annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31, 2023, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." As of August 31, 2023, all of Duke Energy Registrants' reporting units' estimated fair values materially exceeded the carrying values except for the GU&#38;I reporting unit of Duke Energy Ohio. While no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2023, the potential for continued interest rate pressures, and the related impact on the weighted average cost of capital, without timely or adequate updates to the regulated allowed return on equity or deteriorating economic conditions impacting GU&#38;I's future cash flows or equity valuations of peer companies could impact the estimated fair value of GU&#38;I, and goodwill impairment charges could be recorded in the future. The carrying value of goodwill within GU&#38;I for Duke Energy Ohio was approximately $324 million as of December 31, 2023. 

Other 

Duke Energy continues to monitor general market conditions, including the potential for continued interest rate pressures on the Company's cost of capital, which may impact Duke Energy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results, or the achievement of its clean energy goals.

GAAP Reported EPS was $3.54 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3.17 for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the drivers below, the increase in GAAP Reported Earnings/EPS was also due to higher regulatory charges in the prior year. 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A DUKE ENERGY ##TABLE_END

As discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy&#8217;s adjusted EPS was $5.56 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $5.27 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in Adjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS was primarily due to growth from riders and other retail margin, favorable rate case impacts, lower operations and maintenance expense and lower tax expense. These items were partially offset by higher interest and depreciation expense, unfavorable weather and lower volumes. 

SEGMENT RESULTS 

The remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Duke Energy's segment structure includes Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&#38;I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&#38;I). The remainder of Duke Energy&#8217;s operations is presented as Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Business Segments,&#8221; for additional information on Duke Energy&#8217;s segment structure.

EU&#38;I&#8217;s higher segment income was due to higher revenues from rate cases across multiple jurisdictions and the prior year Indiana court rulings on recovery of certain coal ash costs, partially offset by unfavorable weather, lower weather-normal retail sales volumes and higher interest expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by: 

&#8226; a $902 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to higher fuel cost recovery in the current year; 

&#8226; a $363 million increase in storm revenues at Duke Energy Florida due to hurricanes Ian and Nicole collections; 

&#8226; a $276 million increase due to higher pricing at Duke Energy Progress from the South Carolina rate case and interim rates from the North Carolina rate case, the Duke Energy Ohio electric rate case, the Duke Energy Kentucky electric rate case and Ohio tax reform deferrals in prior year, and base rate adjustments related to annual increases from the 2021 Settlement Agreement at Duke Energy Florida; 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A SEGMENT RESULTS - ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE ##TABLE_END

&#8226; a $115 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to a decrease in the return of EDIT to customers compared to the prior year at Duke Energy Carolinas and increased Storm Protection Plan rider revenue at Duke Energy Florida; and 

&#8226; a $67 million increase due to the provision for rate refund recognized in the prior year related to the Indiana Supreme Court ruling on recovery of certain coal ash costs. 

Partially offset by: 

&#8226; a $341 million decrease in retail sales due to unfavorable weather compared to prior year; 

&#8226; a $323 million decrease in wholesale revenues primarily due to lower demand at Duke Energy Florida and lower prices at Duke Energy Indiana; and 

&#8226; a $173 million decrease in weather-normal retail sales volumes. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by: 

&#8226; a $302 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power due to changes in the generation mix at Duke Energy Carolinas and recovery of fuel expense at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida; and 

&#8226; a $134 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher plant in service, partially offset by the amortization of the DOE settlement regulatory liability at Duke Energy Florida. 

Partially offset by: 

&#8226; a $299 million decrease in impairment of assets and other charges primarily due to the Indiana court rulings on recovery of certain coal ash costs in the prior year, partially offset by rate case impacts at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in the current year; and 

&#8226; a $45 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to decrease in spend on outside services and lower project costs at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, partially offset by an increase in storm amortization at Duke Energy Florida. 

Gains on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net. The increase was primarily due to the sale of the Mint Street parking deck. 

Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to non-service pension expense. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily driven by higher interest rates and outstanding debt balances. 

Income Tax Expense. T he increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and a decrease in the amortization of EDIT. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, were 14.7% and 12.0%, respectively. The increase in the ETR was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of EDIT. 

Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. The increase was due to the second and final tranche of the GIC minority interest sale.

GU&#38;I's results were impacted primarily by margin growth partially offset by higher interest expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item. 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by: 

&#8226; a $683 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers, lower volumes, and decreased off-system sales natural gas costs. 

Partially offset by: 

&#8226; a $26 million increase due to customer growth; 

&#8226; a $19 million increase due to North Carolina IMR; 

&#8226; a $15 million increase due to the MGP Settlement in prior year;

&#8226; a $6 million increase in Ohio tax reform deferrals; and 

&#8226; a $4 million increase due to rider revenues. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by: 

&#8226; a $683 million decrease in cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers, lower volumes, and decreased off-system sales natural gas costs; and 

&#8226; a $77 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other due to the MGP Settlement in prior year, lower labor costs, retirement of propane facilities and pipeline safety and integrity work. 

Partially offset by: 

&#8226; a $22 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional plant in service and lower CEP deferrals. 

Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to revisions in estimated ACP ARO closure costs and higher AFUDC equity income. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances and interest rates. 

Income Tax Expense. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of EDIT related to the MGP Settlement recorded in the prior year and an increase in pretax income. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, were 18.3% and 1.7%, respectively.

Year Ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022 

The lower net loss was driven by an increase in the tax benefit due to a favorable adjustment related to certain allowable tax deductions, a franchise tax benefit and higher returns on investments, partially offset by higher interest expense. 

Operating Expenses . The decrease was primarily driven by franchise tax refunds in the current year and higher asset impairments in the prior year, partially offset by higher severance c osts associated with strategic repositioning as the Company transitions to a fully regulated utility. 

Other Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to higher return on investments that fund certain employee benefit obligations and higher yields on captive insurance investments. 

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher interest rates on long-term debt and commercial paper, and higher outstanding long-term debt balances. 

Income Tax Benefit. The increase in the tax benefit was primarily due to benefits associated with ongoing tax efficiency efforts and an increase in pretax losses. The ETRs for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, were 45.2% and 27.9%, respectively. The increase in the ETR was primarily due to benefits associated with ongoing tax efficiency efforts. In 2023, the Company evaluated the deductibility of certain items spanning periods currently open under federal statute, including items related to interest on company-owned life insurance. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately $120 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect the reported results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations. 

Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. 

For further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END

Regulated Operations Accounting 

Substantially all of Duke Energy&#8217;s regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred. 

Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as: 

&#8226; applicable regulatory environment changes; 

&#8226; historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy&#8217;s jurisdictions; 

&#8226; litigation of rate orders; 

&#8226; recent rate orders to other regulated entities; 

&#8226; levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and 

&#8226; the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. 

If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. 

As required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity-specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability. 

For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 

Goodwill Impairment Assessments 

Duke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2023. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2023, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. 

Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy&#8217;s internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2023 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company-specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2023, for each of Duke Energy&#8217;s reporting units ranged from 6.3% to 6.6%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management&#8217;s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges. 

One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer&#8217;s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31. The implied market multiples used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2023, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 9.3 to 11.2. 

Duke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy&#8217;s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates or implied market multiples over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity. 

Duke Energy has $19.3 billion in Goodwill at both December 31, 2023, and 2022. For further information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets." 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

AROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Duke Energy has $9.2 billion and $12.7 billion of AROs as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. See Note 10, "Asset Retirement Obligations," for further details including a rollforward of related liabilities. 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END

The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, regulatory, legal, and legislative decisions, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. 

Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2020, Duke Energy Florida, closed an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station after receiving approval from the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet-to-be-built DOE facility. 

Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. 

For further information, see Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," "Commitments and Contingencies" and "Asset Retirement Obligations." 

Discontinued Operations 

Duke Energy calculated an estimated impairment on the disposition of its Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups as of December 31, 2022. The impairment was recorded to write-down the carrying amount to fair value, less cost to sell. The fair value was primarily determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows, but also considered market information obtained through the bidding process. Estimated future cash flows under the income approach were based on Duke Energy's forecast, which was informed by existing power purchase agreements with offtakers and forward merchant curves. Significant assumptions used in the income approach include forward merchant curves and discount rates. The discount rates take into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. Duke Energy continued to monitor the sales of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups throughout 2023 and recorded adjustments to the impairments as warranted by progression in the disposition process and changes in market information. 

The actual loss for each of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups is being recorded based on final sales agreements and could differ from the estimated losses recorded as of December 31, 2023. 

For further information, See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Dispositions." 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy&#8217;s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IRA, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpa yer until around 2030. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Income Taxes," for more information. 

Capital Expenditures 

Duke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business secto rs. Duke Energy&#8217;s projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.

Other Purchase Obligations 

Other purchase obligations includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services, contractual obligations for Engineering, Procurement, and Construction agreement costs for new generation plants, solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. Total cash commitments for related other purchase obligation expenditures are $12,286 million, with $11,744 million expected to be paid in the next 12 m onths. 

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Leases&#8221; for a schedule of both finance lease and operating lease payments over the next five years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; for information on nuclear decommissioning trust funding obligations and the closure of ash impoundments. 

Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased nonperformance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Guarantees and Indemnifications,&#8221; for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy&#8217;s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed in Note 8 and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Variable Interest Entities." 

Cash and Liquidity 

The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Debt and Credit Facilities,&#8221; for additional information on the money pool arrangement. 

Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy&#8217;s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses. 

As of December 31, 2023, Duke Energy had approximately $253 million of cash on hand, $4.9 billion available under its $9 billion Master Credit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. Refer to Notes 7 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities" and "Stockholders' Equity," respectively, for information regarding Duke Energy's debt and equity issuances, debt maturities and available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility. 

Credit Facilities and Registration Statements 

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants. 

Dividend Payments 

In 2023, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 97th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

Duke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 60% and 70%, based upon adjusted EPS. Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 2% annually in both 2023 and 2022, and the Company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.

Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries 

As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Regulatory Matters,&#8221; Duke Energy&#8217;s public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working ca pital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2023, the amount of restricted net assets of subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy&#8217;s net assets . Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy&#8217;s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations. 

Cash Flows From Operating Activities 

Cash flows from operations of EU&#38;I and GU&#38;I are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy&#8217;s operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations. 

As part of Duke Energy&#8217;s continued effort to improve its cash flows from operations and liquidity, Duke Energy works with vendors to improve terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. To support this effort, Duke Energy has a voluntary supply chain finance program (the &#8220;program&#8221;) under which suppliers, at their sole discretion, may sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the participating financial institution. The financial institution administers the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier&#8217;s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program. Suppliers&#8217; decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy&#8217;s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of Duke Energy, economic downturn or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions willingness to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not believe such risk would have a material impact on our cash flows from operations or liquidity, as substantially all our payments are made outside the program. 

Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for additional information). 

Debt and Equity Issuances 

Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt. 

In 2024, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional securities of $6.9 billion through debt capital markets. In certain in stances, Duke Energy may utilize instruments other than senior notes, including equity-content securities such as subordinated debt or preferred stock. Proceeds will primarily be for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further information regarding significant debt issuances. In addition, in order to fund incremental growth capital, Duke Energy plans to issue $500 million of common stock equity per year through 2028 through the dividend reinvestment and ATM programs. 

Duke Energy&#8217;s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below. 

##TABLE_START &#160; Projected 2024

Restrictive Debt Covenants 

Duke Energy&#8217;s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto . The Duke Energy Registrants were in compliance with all other covenants related to their debt agreements as of December 31, 2023. I n addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.

Credit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies&#8217; assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.

The variance was driven primarily by: 

&#8226; a $2,665 million increase in cash inflows from Other assets and Other liabilities and an $833 million decrease in cash outflows from Working capital, both of which are primarily due to the recovery of deferred fuel costs and the timing of accruals and payments in other working capital accounts; and 

&#8226; a $543 million increase in net income, after adjustment for non-cash items, primarily due to growth from riders and other retail margin, favorable rate case impacts, lower operations and maintenance expense and lower tax expense; partially offset by higher interest expense, unfavorable weather and lower volumes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Risk Management Policies 

The Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategic, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework. 

Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits. 

The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; and &#8220;Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information&#8221; for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein. 

Commodity Price Risk 

Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy&#8217;s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. 

Duke Energy&#8217;s exposure to these fluctuations through its regulated utility operations is limited since these operations are subject to cost-based regulation and are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. 

Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; 

Generation Portfolio Risks 

For the EU&#38;I segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is limited due to mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of most of the net profits from these activities with retail customers. 

Hedging Strategies 

Duke Energy monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas hedging contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy&#8217;s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. 

Duke Energy also manages its exposure to basis risk through the use of congestion hedge products in RTOs such as financial transmission rights (PJM and MISO), which result in payments based on differentials in locational marginal prices. The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy&#8217;s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract&#8217;s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring. 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END

Interest Rate Risk 

Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; &#8220;Debt and Credit Facilities,&#8221; &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging,&#8221; and &#8220;Fair Value Measurements.&#8221; 

Duke Energ y had $8.0 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2023. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $80 million at December 31, 2023. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2023. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 

Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as a result of its issuances of long-term debt denominated in a foreign currency. Duke Energy manages foreign currency exchange risk exposure by entering into cross-currency swaps, a type of financial derivative instrument, which mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure. See Notes 7, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Debt and Credit Facilities,&#8221; &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging&#8221; and &#8220;Fair Value Measurements," respectively. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits. 

To reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions. 

The Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging,&#8221; for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments. 

The Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; credit risk. 

The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk. 

Credit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment to assist customers during the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the Company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the Company has resumed standard payment arrangement options. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants experienced higher charge-offs during 2023, but lower utility account balances in arrears as of December 31, 2023. There is an expectation for the higher levels of charge-offs to continue. The Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 4 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Revenue," respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Variable Interest Entities.&#8221; 

The Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.

Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims. 

The Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Guarantees and Indemnifications,&#8221; for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants. 

Duke Energy is subject to credit risk from transactions with counterparties to cross-currency swaps related to future interest and principal payments. The credit exposure to such counterparties may take the form of higher costs to meet Duke Energy's future euro-denominated interest and principal payments in the event of counterparty default. Duke Energy selects highly rated banks as counterparties and allocates the hedge for each debt issuance across multiple counterparties. The master agreements with the counterparties impose collateral requirements on the parties in certain circumstances indicative of material deterioration in a party's creditworthiness. 

Based on the Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty. 

Marketable Securities Price Risk 

As described further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,&#8221; Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 

Pension Plan Assets 

Duke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Employee Benefit Plans,&#8221; for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets. 

A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy&#8217;s results of operations in those periods. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds 

As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2023, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes. 

Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the funds will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations,&#8221; for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,&#8221; for additional information regarding NDTF assets. 

OTHER MATTERS 

Environmental Regulations 

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants. 

The following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants. 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A OTHER MATTERS ##TABLE_END

Greenhouse Gas Standards and Guidelines 

On May 23, 2023, the EPA published in the Federal Register proposed new source performance standards under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(b) that would establish standards of performance for emissions of greenhouse gases (expressed as carbon dioxide (CO 2 )) for newly constructed, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating units and fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines. On that same day, in a separate rulemaking under CAA section 111(d), the EPA published proposed emission guidelines for states to use in developing plans to limit CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and certain large existing stationary combustion turbines. Duke Energy is reviewing the proposed rules and analyzing the potential impacts they could have on the Company, which could be material. A final rule is anticipated in the second quarter of 2024. 

Coal Combustion Residuals 

In April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. 

On May 18, 2023, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which would establish regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at inactive generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments) and establish groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure and post-closure care requirements for all CCR management units at facilities otherwise subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy is reviewing the proposed rule and analyzing the potential impacts it could have on the Company, which could be material. A final rule is anticipated in the second quarter of 2024. 

In addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy&#8217;s regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and "Asset Retirement Obligations," respectively. 

Coal Ash Act 

AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. 

Consistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective action plans to NCDEQ. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans for six sites in North Carolina and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans for all 14 North Carolina sites to NCDEQ. In addition, from 2020 through 2023, Duke Energy submitted updated comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective action plans for the remaining North Carolina sites. 

On April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, J.E. Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate six of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the three remaining basins at Belews Creek, Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Belews Creek, Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations. 

The estimated total cost to permanently close all coal ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is estimated to be approximately $7 billion to $8 billion of which approximately $4 billion has been spent through 2023. The majority of the remaining spend is primarily expected to occur over the next 10 years. Duke Energy has completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend, Dan River, Asheville and Sutton plants. 

For further information on coal ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters" and &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations,&#8221; respectively. 

North Carolina House Bill 951 

On October 13, 2021, HB 951 was signed into law, establishing a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO 2 emission reductions from electric generating facilities in the state through the use of least cost planning while providing for continued reliability and affordable rates for customers served by such generation. It also authorized the use of PBR in North Carolina. Among other things, HB 951 required the NCUC to: 

&#8226; develop a carbon plan that would target a 70% interim reduction in CO 2 emissions from public utilities' electric generation in the state on the least cost path to carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology; 

&#8226; adopt rules to implement the requirements of the Legislation authorizing PBR that includes MYRP with a maximum three-year term, performance incentive mechanisms to track utility performance, and revenue decoupling for the residential customer class; 

##TABLE_START MD&#38;A OTHER MATTERS ##TABLE_END

&#8226; establish rules to securitize costs associated with the early retirement of subcritical coal-fired electric generating facilities necessary to achieve the authorized carbon reduction goals at 50% of remaining net book value, with the remaining net book value recovered through normal cost-of-service basis; and 

&#8226; initiate a process for updating rates and terms of certain existing solar PPAs executed under PURPA. 

In October 2022 and January 2023, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, respectively, filed applications with the NCUC, which proposed implementation of HB 951&#8217;s provisions around PBR, including MYRP, residential decoupling and performance incentive mechanisms. Additionally, on December 30, 2022, the NCUC issued an order adopting the first Carbon Plan as directed by the Legislation with the Carbon Plan to be updated every two years thereafter. Wi th this order, the NCUC recognized the value of an &#8220;all of the above&#8221; approach to achieving CO 2 emission reductions and established a set of near-term procurement and development activities needed to continue progress towards the targeted CO 2 reductions, along with the schedule for the future biennial updates to the Carbon Plan. The NCUC approved a near-term action plan including stakeholder engagement activities for onshore wind generation and certain procurement and development activities to strengthen the grid, improve resilience for customers and interconnect new generation and storage (in all cases, subject to any further applicable regulatory processes). The NCUC also approved early development activities for long lead-time resources, affirmed the ownership structure required in HB 951, and provided an orderly transition out of coal generation by 2035. 

I n August 2023 and December 2023, the NCUC issued orders approving Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Carolinas' PBR Applications, respectively, as modified by the partial settlements and the orders. See Note 4, "Regulatory Matters" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 

Other Environmental Regulations 

The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 

Global Climate Change and Regulation of GHG Emissions 

In 2021, President Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and announced a new target for the United States of 50% to 52% reduction in economywide net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. submittal to support this Paris target includes a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. These actions have been supplemented by a number of executive orders by President Biden and a number of proposed and final rules from federal regulatory agencies, including the EPA, that would impose additional regulations on CO 2 and methane emissions to which Duke Energy will be subject. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring these matters and cannot predict the outcome, however, there could be a material impact on our clean energy transition. 

EU&#38;I CO 2 Emissions Reductions 

The Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; direct GHG emissions consist primarily of CO 2 that results primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to serve its customers reliably and affordably. In 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with new goals of at least a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels from electric generation by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. In February 2022, we added Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from upstream purchased power and fossil fuel purchases, as well as downstream customer use of natural gas, to our 2050 net-zero goal. In October 2022, we announced an additional interim target to reduce carbon emissions from electric generation by 80% from 2005 levels by 2040. Duke Energy also adopted an interim goal of reducing Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions mentioned above by 50% below 2021 levels by 2035. 

The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO 2 emissions over time . Between 2005 and 2023, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO 2 emissions from their electricity generation by 48%. T imelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of GHG emissions will vary in each state in which the Company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. The goals announced in 2019, and updated in 2022, as well as the actions taken to reduce CO 2 emissions, potentially lower the exposure to any future mandatory CO 2 emission reduction requirements, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. 

Actions to reduce CO 2 emissions have included the retirement of 56 coal-fired electric generating units with a combined generating capacity of 7,500 MW, while investing in renewables and state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity generated than coal. Duke Energy also has made investments to increase EE offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-CO 2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO 2 emissions. 

Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO 2 emissions, including EE, wind, solar and storage, as well as evolving technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear, in its efforts to achieve its net-zero goal as well as to comply with any future regulations. Duke Energy plans to adjust to and incorporate evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability of energy while meeting regulatory requirements and customer demands. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO 2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. Future levels of GHG emissions by the Duke Energy Registrants will be influenced by variables that include customer growth and capacity needs in the jurisdictions in which they operate, public policy, tax incentives, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, fuel prices, market prices, availability of resources and labor, compliance with new or existing regulations, the ability to make enhancements to transmission and distribution systems to support increased renewables, and the existence of new technologies that can be deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet customer demand. 

Currently, the Duke Energy Registrants do not purchase carbon credits or offsets for use in connection with the Company's net-zero CO 2 emissions goals. Though they may purchase carbon credits or offsets for such uses in the future, the amount or cost of which is not expected to be material at this time.

Generation Mix Planning Process 

The Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the Company&#8217;s thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term generation resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction. 

For a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO 2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO 2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO 2 emissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO 2 price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the Company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO 2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes. 

In September 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their IRPs in North Carolina and South Carolina, and, in December 2021, Duke Energy Indiana filed its IRP, outlining an accelerated energy transition, which aligns with the Company's 2030 CO 2 emissions goal. In December 2021, the PSCSC rejected Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress&#8217; preferred accelerated coal retirements IRP scenario and instead found that the base case without a price on CO 2 emissions was the most reasonable IRP scenario. 

In 2021, the state of North Carolina passed HB 951, which among other things, directed the NCUC to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan by the end of 2022 that would target a 70% reduction in CO 2 emissions from Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Carolinas' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology. In light of this legislation, in November 2021, the NCUC declined to make a determination on the portfolios presented in the 2020 IRP noting that the legislation may impact the schedule for coal plant retirements and new resources and limited its order to short-term actions for use on an interim basis pending preparation of the carbon plan. The NCUC approved its initial carbon reduction plan in December 2022, which considered feedback from extensive stakeholder engagement and was informed by Duke Energy's initial proposed carbon plan, filed with the NCUC on May 16, 2022, and built on the IRPs that were filed in 2020 by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. 

In August 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their 2023 systemwide Carolinas Resource Plan (the Plan) with the NCUC and PSCS C. T he Plan provided a range of generation options, including three core portfolios, reflecting an &#8220;all of the above&#8221; approach to powering the energy needs of our growing region. In the Plan, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recommended Portfolio 3 as the most prudent path forward to comply with applicable state laws, providing a reliable and orderly energy transition that was proposed as the most reasonable and lowest-cost plan for the Carolinas. Portfolio 3 proposes a diverse and reliable set of generation and energy storage solutions and shrinks the challenges of growth and the transition from coal by expanding industry-leading EE and demand response options, laying out a path to reliably exit coal by 2035. Portfolio 3 also makes the most of existing system resources by extending the lives of Duke Energy&#8217;s nuclear plants and extending the license and doubling the peak hourly capacity of the Bad Creek pumped-hydro storage facility. Near-term actions consistent with Portfolio 3 were also proposed that will be executed between now and 2026 to advance the orderly energy transition. In November 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress provided notice to the NCUC and PSCSC of a substantially increased load forecast resulting from increased economic development in the Carolinas occurring since the system-wide Plan was prepared. The companies filed supplemental modeling and analysis with the NCUC and PSCSC in January 2024, demonstrating the need for additional resources beyond the initial set of resources identified by the companies in their initial plan. The NCUC has scheduled an evidentiary hearing for July 2024, with an order expected by the end of 2024. The PSCSC will hold its hearing in September 2024 with a decision expected in late November 2024. 

GU&#38;I CO 2 and Methane Emissions Reductions 

In addition to CO 2 emissions resulting primarily from our operations of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants are also responsible for certain methane emissions from the distribution of natural gas to customers. In October 2020, Duke Energy announced a new goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution business by 2030. The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in methane emission reductions, including the replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipelines and associated services with plastic or coated steel, advanced methane leak detection efforts, reducing time to repair nonhazardous leaks and operational releases of methane, and investment in renewable natural gas. 

Timelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of upstream methane emissions will vary in each state in which the Company&#8217;s natural gas distribution business operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. EPA has also proposed regulations that would require reduction of methane emissions upstream of the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution business. The impact of these regulations on natural gas fuel prices is not currently quantifiable. 

In addition to possible EPA regulation of methane emissions, certain local governments, none within the jurisdictions in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate, have enacted or are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in new buildings and focus on electrification. Enactment of similar regulations in the areas in which the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution operates could have a significant impact on the natural gas distribution business and its operations. At this time, such impacts are not able to be quantified; however, the net-zero methane goals announced in 2020 for the natural gas distribution business, as well as the actions taken to reduce these GHG emissions, potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs with any new regulations through the regulatory process.

Physical Impacts of Climate Change 

The Duke Energy Registrants recognize that scientists associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere. It is possible that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating with any certainty any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; operations difficult. Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to continue to seek recovery of storm costs through the appropriate regulatory mechanisms. For more information on storm securitization and storm cost recovery, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 

The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric transmission and distribution systems and natural gas facilities. The steps include modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing systems and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; electric generating facilities and natural gas facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain inventories of coal, oil and liquified natural gas to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity and/or natural gas.
